Create an node application for city transport tikcet booking app with following points

1. Stations List : APIs to Manage (Create / Update / Delete ) list of Stations
      Station Name

2. RouteList : APIs to mange cost between two stations, only direct routes will be there in system means if we have route A-B, A-D, C-D are defined in system then one can choose from that only, no intermidiate stations booking like A-C will be allowed as there is no route defined for A-C 
     From Station (ID)
     To Station (ID)
     PRICE (ID)
3. Ticket Generation & Validation 
  > Generate tikcet based on from and to stations  (Only Direct path will be   there from RouteList).
 > Ticket will be valid till 150 mins only from it has been booked
> Final Tikcet wll include details like From & To station , Price and Unique hash which to identify and validate ticket.  Hash will have complete details like From ,To , Price & Ticket valid From and Valid to time to validate
